# FPX_demo 

This project is a collection of simple JavaFX applications designed to demonstrate fundamental UI concepts and capabilities. Each file serves as a self-contained example of a specific feature, such as managing text input or generating graphical shapes. 

Features 

Text Input Binding: An example showing how to bind the value of one text field to another, so they always display the same text. 

Dynamic Shape Generation: A simple application that programmatically draws a series of concentric, randomly colored circles. 

Basic UI Structure: Demonstrations of using standard JavaFX layouts and controls to build a simple graphical interface.
