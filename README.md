# FPX_demo
This project is a collection of simple JavaFX applications designed to demonstrate fundamental UI concepts and capabilities. Each file serves as a self-contained example of a specific feature, such as managing text input or generating graphical shapes.

Features
Text Input Binding: An example showing how to bind the value of one text field to another, so they always display the same text.

Dynamic Shape Generation: A simple application that programmatically draws a series of concentric, randomly colored circles.

Basic UI Structure: Demonstrations of using standard JavaFX layouts and controls to build a simple graphical interface.

Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need to have the following installed and configured in your IDE:

Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher

JavaFX SDK: You must have the JavaFX libraries configured in your project's build path.

Getting Started
Since this project contains multiple entry points, you can run each demonstration individually from your IDE.

From your IDE:

Open the project in your IDE (e.g., Eclipse or IntelliJ).

Navigate to the specific file you want to run.

Right-click on the file (first.java, Main.java, or circles.java).

Select "Run As" -> "Java Application".

(Note: If you are using a build tool like Maven or Gradle, you will need to configure the appropriate main class in your pom.xml or build.gradle file before running from the command line.)
